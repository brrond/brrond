# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniil Onishchenko. I'm 21 y.o. Computer Science Student from Ukraine. 

Although I am almost finished my Bachelor degree, I'm still not sure what I want to do in my professional life. I have interests in backend development (Java), machine learning (Python, TF + and stuff) but I also like the idea of creating OpenGL, Win32 and Vulkan application in C++ (maybe in the future).

## âœ… TODO

<ul>
  <li><b>Pix2Pix-Keras</b> Library for atomized Pix2Pix model creation that will be compatible with Keras.</li>
  <!--<li><b>Share-a-model</b> Website for users to shair their `.h5` models with different hd5f, keras, tf2 support. Website for personal use only.</li>-->
</ul>

## ðŸ“– TO learn

<ul>
  <li>OpenGL</li>
  <li>Win32API</li>
  <li>Vulkan</li>
  <li>PyTorch</li>
</ul>
